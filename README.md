# Sign Language Detection using CNN and LSTM

Welcome to the Sign Language Detection project repository! This project focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) to detect and recognize signs in sign language videos.

## Overview

Sign language detection is an important application of computer vision and deep learning techniques. Our project aims to develop a model capable of accurately recognizing signs from video sequences of sign language gestures.

## Technologies Used

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm commonly used for image classification and object detection tasks. In our project, CNNs are used to extract features from video frames and detect signs from sign language videos.

### Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to model sequential data and capture temporal dependencies. In our project, LSTMs are used to process sequences of CNN feature representations extracted from video frames and make predictions about sign language gestures.

### Python
Python is the primary programming language used for developing our sign language detection model. We utilize popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to implement CNNs and LSTMs.

## Features

- **Video Input**: Our model accepts video sequences of sign language gestures as input.
- **Frame Extraction**: Video frames are extracted from the input video sequences.
- **CNN Feature Extraction**: CNNs are used to extract features from individual video frames.
- **LSTM Sequence Processing**: LSTMs process sequences of CNN feature representations to capture temporal dependencies.
- **Sign Language Detection**: The model predicts the sign language gesture represented by the input video sequence.

## Getting Started

To run the sign language detection model and test it with your own sign language videos, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-detection.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script to start the sign language detection:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
